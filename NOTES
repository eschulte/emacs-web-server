* Notes
* Tasks [8/9]
** DONE Documentation [6/6]
- [X] introduction
- [X] handlers
- [X] request headers
- [X] usage examples
- [X] list of functions

Notes to touch upon
- [X] how to set content type

** DONE Handle POST requests
1. read standard for POST data
2. parse multi-line headers with boundaries

For now keep this all incremental and in ews-filter.

** DONE Makefile
- byte-compile
- package
- test
- benchmark
** DONE catch errors and return an error code
include an easy error handler like the 404 handler

** DONE better parsing of multipart form blocks
parse more than just the content-type headers.

** DONE non-multipart form data
e.g., parameter strings

** DONE some more convenience functionality [6/6]
- [X] strip and parse URL query string
- [X] parse urlencoded post data
- [X] think about defaulting to (name . content) for form elements
- [X] maybe don't require a non-nil return to cancel the connection,
      instead only keep open if :keep-open is returned
- [X] function to send a file (with mime handling)
- [X] send a 404 with some default text

** CANCELED Lazy header processing
   - State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-12-25 Wed 12:21] \\
     premature optimization
Use lazy sequence functions for header a-list to avoid parsing all
headers.  For regexp matchers should stop when matched header is
encountered (often the first one when :GET), For function matchers
provide lazy version of assoc.

Also, there is the issue of how a lazy request for more parameters
should act before all incoming text has been received.  Emacs does not
provide a light-weight mechanism for a function to wait for incoming
process text without something gross like the =(sit-for 0.1)= used in
the test suite.

** TODO use gnutls for https
I think this should work.
