* Notes
* Tasks [6/9]
** TODO Documentation [0/4]
- [ ] introduction
- [ ] handlers
- [ ] request headers
- [ ] usage examples
- [ ] list of functions

** DONE Handle POST requests
1. read standard for POST data
2. parse multi-line headers with boundaries

For now keep this all incremental and in ews-filter.

** DONE Makefile
- byte-compile
- package
- test
- benchmark
** DONE catch errors and return an error code
include an easy error handler like the 404 handler

** DONE better parsing of multipart form blocks
parse more than just the content-type headers.

** DONE non-multipart form data
e.g., parameter strings

** DONE some more convenience functionality [6/6]
- [X] strip and parse URL query string
- [X] parse urlencoded post data
- [X] think about defaulting to (name . content) for form elements
- [X] maybe don't require a non-nil return to cancel the connection,
      instead only keep open if :keep-open is returned
- [X] function to send a file (with mime handling)
- [X] send a 404 with some default text

** TODO Lazy header processing
Use lazy sequence functions for header a-list to avoid parsing all
headers.  For regexp matchers should stop when matched header is
encountered (often the first one when :GET), For function matchers
provide lazy version of assoc.

** TODO use gnutls for https
I think this should work.
* Documentation
** Writing Handlers
*** Matching
*** Handler Functions
At any time one can throw =close-connection= to abort the handler and
close the conncetion.  If the keyword =:keep-open= is thrown, then the
handler aborts, but the connection isn't closed.

A return value of =:keep-open= will keep the connection open,
otherwise it is closed when the handler returns.
