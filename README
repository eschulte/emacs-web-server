                           Emacs Web Server

DESCRIPTION
    A web server in Emacs running handlers written in Emacs Lisp.

REQUIREMENTS
    Emacs 24.3 or later.

STATUS
    This is a new project without much extended use so there are
    likely bugs and potentially security issues.  That said it
    consists of little more than HTTP header parsing logic perched
    atop Emacs' existing network process primitives, so it should be
    fairly robust.

EXAMPLES
    See the examples/ directory in this repository.  The Emacs Web
    Server is also used to run a paste server [1] and serve editable
    Org-mode pages [2].

    online [3].
